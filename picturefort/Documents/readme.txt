Version 1 - Initial Release

--NOTES--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was intrigued by the idea of Chromafort, but it never really worked for me. So I made this little utility on a Sunday afternoon for myself.
I figured it worked wonderfully for me, so I might as well release it. It works on any type of image more or less, so you don't have to worry about
powers of two, image size, aspect ratio, the phase of the moon, or format of the image -- within reason. 

 - Compressed formats such as .gif/.jpg create more colors than you painted. Stick to .bmp/.png for best results.
 - Currently only tested on Windows, but a Linux version should be forthcoming sometime soon.
 - 16 bit and lower images are not supported. (If you reall want to use them let me know)
 - There is a hard limit to 64 distinct colors. (I'm pretty sure there aren't even 64 designations)

--HOW TO USE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.) Create an image of your desired fort. Each pixel represents one tile ingame. Each distinct color can have its own designation of your choosing. 

2.) Run picturefort.exe, click "Choose Image"

3.) Enter in the designation you want associated with each color (d for dig, h for channel, etc.)
	3b.) optionally change the default #dig header for Quickfort's advanced features

4.) Click "Convert Image" -- your csv will be created in the same folder with the same name as the image

5.) Run Quickfort while playing Dwarf Fortress, and load up your shiny new template.
