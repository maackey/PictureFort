Notes
-----

I was intrigued by the idea of Chromafort, but it never really worked for me. So I made this little utility on a Sunday afternoon for myself.
I figured it worked wonderfully for me, so I might as well release it. It works on any type of image more or less, so you don't have to worry about
powers of two, image size, aspect ratio, the phase of the moon, or format of the image -- within reason. 

 - Lossy formats such as .gif/.jpg can create more colors than you painted. Stick to lossless filetypes (eg. .bmp/.png) for best results.
 

How to use
----------

1. Create an image of your desired fort. Each pixel represents one tile ingame. Each distinct color can have its own designation of your choosing. 

2. Run picturefort.exe, click "Load Image(s)". Select the image (or images) that you want to convert.

3. The "Color Designations" tab will generate a list of entries from the currently loaded images where you can enter your designations per color.

4. Select which type of template(s) to create (dig, build, place, query) and add any respective comments each one should have. 

5. Select the drawing start position.

6. Save your template(s):
    - The "Output File" textbox will specify the name of the file. If left blank, the template will have the same name as the originating image.
    - The "Output Path" textbox will specify the directory generated templates will be created in. If left blank, they will be created in the same directory as the images.
    - "Single Template" will create a single template from the loaded images. Each image is its own z-level.
    - "Batch Templates" will create multiple templates from the loaded images. Each file is its own template.

7. Run Quickfort while playing Dwarf Fortress, and load up your shiny new template.
